algorithm:
  name: Annoy
  description: >
    Implements Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) for efficient approximate nearest neighbor searches.
    Designed for memory efficiency and high-speed retrieval, suitable for real-time applications.
  type: vector_search
  version: 1.0
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      num_trees:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The number of trees to build for the Annoy index. More trees give higher precision at the cost of increased memory and indexing time.
        default: 10
      dimension:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The dimensionality of the vectors.
        default: 128
      metric:
        type: string
        description: >
          The distance metric to use (e.g., angular, euclidean, manhattan, hamming, dot).
        enum: [ angular, euclidean, manhattan, hamming, dot ]
        default: angular
    additional_properties: false
    required:
      - dimension
      - metric
  response:
    type: object
    properties:
      index:
        type: string
        description: >
          The identifier for the created Annoy index.
      search_results:
        type: array
        description: >
          A list of nearest neighbors for the query vector.
        items:
          type: object
          properties:
            vector_id:
              type: integer
              description: >
                The identifier of the nearest vector.
            distance:
              type: number
              description: >
                The distance between the query vector and the nearest vector.
