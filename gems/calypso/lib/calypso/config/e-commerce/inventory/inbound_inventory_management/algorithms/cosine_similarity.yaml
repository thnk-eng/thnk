  name: CosineSimilarity
  description: >
    Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between them,
    providing a value between -1 and 1 where 1 indicates identical orientation, 0 indicates orthogonality, and -1 indicates opposite orientation.
