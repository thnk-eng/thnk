algorithm:
  name: KMeansClustering
  description: >
    Implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment users or products into distinct clusters based on their features.
    Useful for customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and inventory categorization.
  type: clustering

            type: number
        description: >
          A 2D array where each sub-array represents the feature vector of a user or product.
      num_clusters:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The number of clusters to form.
        default: 5
      max_iterations:
        type: integer
        description: >
          The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.
        default: 300
