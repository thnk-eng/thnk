algorithm:
  name: KnuthMorrisPratt
  description: >
    Implements the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring search within a main string.
    KMP improves the search by eliminating redundant comparisons.
  type: string_matching
  version: 1.0
  parameters:
    type: object
    properties:
      text:
        type: string
        description: >
          The main string in which to search for the pattern.
      pattern:
        type: string
        description: >
          The substring pattern to search for within the main string.

        description: >
          An array of starting indices where the pattern is found within the main text.
