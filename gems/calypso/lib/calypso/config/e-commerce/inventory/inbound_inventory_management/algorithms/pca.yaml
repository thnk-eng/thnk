algorithm:
  name: PrincipalComponentAnalysis
  description: >
    Implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, transforming high-dimensional data into lower dimensions
    while preserving as much variance as possible. Useful for data visualization, noise reduction, and improving algorithm performance.
